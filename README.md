## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the code for **Lab 5** in CSE 120. The lab focuses on **reading CSV files, using functions, and handling user input** in Python.  

The program allows the user to:  
1. Input a **city** and a **month**  
2. Retrieve the **average high and low temperatures** from a CSV file (`weather_temps.csv`)  

The goal of this lab was to practice:  
- Reading and processing **CSV files** in Python  
- Using **functions** to organize code  
- Handling **user input**  
- Implementing **conditional logic** for missing data

## 🛠️ File Included
- **CSE-120-Lab-5.py** – Reads weather data from a CSV file and outputs high and low temperatures for a given city and month  
- **weather_temps.csv** – CSV file containing average high and low temperatures by city and month

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed on your machine  
2. Ensure the CSV file is available at the path specified in the script  
3. Open a terminal or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)  
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python CSE-120-Lab-5.py
